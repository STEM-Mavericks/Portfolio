            <h3>Automated Waste Segregation System</h3>
            <p>The Automated Waste Segregation System enhances waste management efficiency by automating the segregation of dry and wet waste. This app is made user-friendly, allowing users to efficiently utilize the model and contribute to environmental cleanliness.</p>
            
            <h4>Features</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Automated Waste Segregation: Utilizes a moisture sensor to differentiate between dry and wet waste, directing each type to the appropriate compartment.</li>
                <li>Weight Measurement: Employs a load sensor to measure the weight of the waste, helping monitor waste generation and avoid overloading the bin.</li>
                <li>Bin Capacity Monitoring: Uses an ultrasonic sensor to continuously monitor the bin's capacity, alerting users when the bin is nearing full capacity to prevent overflow.</li>
                <li>Real-Time Data and Alerts: Features a web application that displays real-time data on waste segregation, bin capacity, and waste weight, along with alerts and notifications for timely waste disposal.</li>
                <li>Detailed Waste Analytics: Generates reports on waste production, including daily, weekly, and monthly metrics, to help users track and manage their waste generation patterns.</li>
                <li>Durable and Adaptable Design: Suitable for humid to arid environments, making it suitable for residential areas, public spaces, and industrial sites.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Components</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Sensors</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Moisture Sensor: Detects the moisture content of waste to classify it as wet or dry.</li>
                    <li>Load Sensor: Measures the weight of the waste in the bin to provide data for weight reports.</li>
                    <li>Ultrasonic Sensor: Monitors the level of waste in the bin and alerts users when the bin is nearly full.</li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong>Actuators</strong></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Motorized Actuator: Connected to a flap mechanism that segregates waste into designated compartments based on real-time data from the sensors.</li>
                    <li>Motor-Driven Conveyor or Sliding Mechanism: Facilitates the movement of waste within the bin, enhancing the efficiency of the segregation process.</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h4>How It Works</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Detection: The moisture sensor detects the moisture content of the waste to determine whether it is wet or dry.</li>
                <li>Segregation: Based on the moisture content, the actuator moves the waste to the appropriate compartment.</li>
                <li>Weight Measurement: The load sensor measures the weight of the waste and updates this data on the web app.</li>
                <li>Capacity Monitoring: The ultrasonic sensor monitors the binâ€™s capacity, providing alerts when the bin is nearly full.</li>
                <li>Data Visualization: The web app displays real-time data and analytics, helping users track waste generation and management.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Real-Life Problems Solved</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Improved Waste Sorting: Automates the process of sorting dry and wet waste, reducing human error and increasing recycling efficiency.</li>
                <li>Enhanced Waste Management: Provides real-time monitoring and alerts to prevent bin overflow and maintain cleanliness.</li>
                <li>Supports Sustainability: Promotes recycling and reduces landfill waste, contributing to a cleaner environment.</li>
            </ul>
